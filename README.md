# This is a IBM Data Science course repository
The project is based on a question: "Can we predict SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing?". <br>
This big project is divided into 8 parts:
1. Web Scraping.
2. Data collection.
3. Data Wrangling.
4. EDA with sqlite.
5. EDA with data visualization.
6. Creating a dashboard with dash.
7. Interactive visual analytics using Folium.
8. Machine Learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land.

At the end, there's a presentation in which it fully details the tools, processes and findings in each of those section.
